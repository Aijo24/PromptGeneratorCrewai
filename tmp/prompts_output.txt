### Detailed AI Prompts for Project Tasks

---

#### Task 1: Requirements Gathering

**Context:** The first phase of the project involves defining the objectives and collecting user requirements from stakeholders to ensure that the AI software solution meets their needs.

**Prompt:**
"Please conduct a requirements gathering session with project stakeholders. The aim is to define the project scope and identify user needs for the AI application. Provide a list of essential features that align with client expectations. 

**Instructions:**
- Organize and conduct a structured interview or survey.
- Include both functional and non-functional requirements.
- Ensure clarity in each requirement to avoid ambiguity.

**Constraints/Requirements:**
- Deliver the requirements in a structured format (e.g., user stories, acceptance criteria).
- Limit the response to a maximum of 1500 words.
- Prioritize requirements based on feasibility and impact on user experience.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness: All relevant requirements are documented.
- Clarity: Requirements are clearly articulated and unambiguous.
- Relevance: Requirements align with the project’s objectives.

**Example Output:**
- User Story: “As a user, I want to receive personalized recommendations based on my preferences so that I can find relevant content easily.”

#### Task 2: Design Development 

**Context:** In this phase, the UI/UX team is responsible for creating intuitive designs that account for user needs and facilitate a pleasant user experience.

**Prompt:**
"Develop the UI/UX designs for the AI application. Your designs should reflect the user requirements identified in the previous phase and ensure usability and aesthetic appeal.

**Instructions:**
- Create wireframes and mockups for all key screens.
- Include design specifications such as colors, typography, and interactive elements.
- Ensure designs are mobile-responsive.

**Constraints/Requirements:**
- Designs must adhere to accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).
- Provide a rationale for each design decision.
- The submission should not exceed 30 pages, including appendices.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Usability: Design should facilitate easy navigation.
- Visual appeal: Aesthetic quality of the designs.
- Responsiveness: Designs must work well on different devices.

**Example Output:**
- Wireframe of the homepage showcasing a simple, intuitive layout with clearly marked sections for user engagement.

#### Task 3: AI Module Development 

**Context:** The AI Engineers will develop the backend AI functionalities that will power the application's features based on the requirements gathered.

**Prompt:**
"Implement the AI module for the application. The module should address the requirements specified earlier and perform efficiently.

**Instructions:**
- Develop algorithms based on defined user scenarios.
- Ensure code is scalable and maintainable, with appropriate documentation.
- Integrate with projected data sources for model training.

**Constraints/Requirements:**
- Use Python and any preferred AI frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
- Adhere to coding standards and best practices.
- Performance benchmarks must be included to validate the model.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Functionality: Code meets the specified requirements.
- Performance: AI model should perform within acceptable latency ranges.
- Documentation: Code is well-commented and includes usage guidelines.

**Example Output:**
- A Python script implementing a recommendation algorithm with accompanying documentation explaining its functionality.

#### Task 4: Testing 

**Context:** The QA Team is responsible for testing the application to ensure reliability, functionality, and a seamless user experience before deployment.

**Prompt:**
"Conduct comprehensive testing of the AI application after the development phase. Your testing should cover unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.

**Instructions:**
- Develop a test plan specifying test cases and scenarios.
- Document test results and any identified bugs or issues.
- Perform regression testing to ensure that new features do not disrupt existing functionalities.

**Constraints/Requirements:**
- Use testing tools such as Selenium for automated tests.
- All tests must be reproducible.
- Maintain a bug tracking system for effective resolution management.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Coverage: All critical functionalities are tested.
- Detail: Test documentation is thorough and organized.
- Usability feedback: User acceptance test results provide insight into user experience.

**Example Output:**
- A detailed test report summarizing test cases, outcomes, and a list of bugs categorized by severity.

#### Task 5: Deployment 

**Context:** The DevOps Engineer will prepare the application for launch, ensuring that the environment is ready and that clients can easily access the new software.

**Prompt:**
"Prepare for the deployment of the AI application after testing is complete. Your task is to ensure the application launches smoothly and that support mechanisms are in place.

**Instructions:**
- Create a deployment checklist that includes necessary configurations and pre-launch tests.
- Plan for post-deployment support and troubleshooting.
- Update any relevant documentation for users.

**Constraints/Requirements:**
- Coordinate with all teams to confirm readiness.
- Ensure that backup plans are in place in case of deployment failures.
- Deployment should be fully scripted to enable repeatability.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness: All aspects of deployment are documented and reviewed.
- Success rate: Ensure successful launch with minimal issues.
- Preparedness: Post-launch support is clearly defined and established.

**Example Output:**
- A deployment plan that outlines steps to be taken, roles responsible, and a rollback strategy in case of failure.
